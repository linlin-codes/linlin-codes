**`Digital Craftsman (Student/Coding Intern)`**

I'm a student enrolled at Julia R. Masterman Secondary School, where I discovered my passion for computer science and engineering. As a novice in coding, I'm constantly seeking opportunities to expand my knowledge and skills in the world of technology. My journey in computer science is attributed to my aspirations to make a positive impact in the real world, and to use my knowledge and skills to serve the community.
